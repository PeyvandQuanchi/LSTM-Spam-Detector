A deep learning-based email classifier built with tensorflow and keras. 
This project uses an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network to classify emails as spam/not spam, utilizing sequal patterns in text for accurate predictions.

#**Features**

* Text preprocessing using TextVectorization and embedding layers for dense word representation.
* LSTM and GlobalMaxPooling layers to extract contextual features from message sequences.
* User-friendly predict function to test new messages interactively.
